
== LastTweet module

LastTweet is a lightweight Drupal module which allows to display last tweet from some
Twitter account. It was build as an opposite to existing robust Twitter module. It
provides the most simple way how to get and display last tweet. It uses only Drupal cache
to store last tweets, so if you want more, like Twitter history, Views support etc.
you probably want to use the previously mentioned Twitter module
(http://drupal.org/project/twitter).

== Questions

Why this module isn't hosted on Drupal.org?

Author of this module respects the rule from Drupal Standards: there should be only one
module with given functionality hosted on Drupal.org and there is also the rule saying
that module which is only simplier version of some more complex module should be
abandoned.
